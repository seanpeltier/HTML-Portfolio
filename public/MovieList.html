  <h1>The Top 3 Greatest Movies According to Sean</h1>

  <hr>
  <h2>Halloween (1978)</h2>
  <p>There isn't much I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It is the ultimate horror movie. It's a simple execution. There isn't alot of blood and you don't really see many of the kills. It didn't need to be over the top or gory. It relies more on the imagination and leaves you with a sense of dread. 
  </p>
  
  <p>This movie paved the way for so many films. A simple premise, a remolded Captain Kirk Mask and a haunting synth them song by the genius composer, John Carpenter and you're left with a film that has given millions of people nightmares.</p>

  <h2>It Follows</h2>

  <p>As a fellow horror fan, I'm so tired of people saying there aren't any original horror movies anymore. Whenever I hear this, I respond with <q><em>Have you watched It Follows?</em></q></p><p></p>This movie is one that is best if you go in knowing as little as possible. I saw this one in theaters, and needless to say, when I left the theater, I was constantly looking in my rearview mirror to see if anyone was following me. The replayability is high and you'll always find something new with each viewing. Add a score by the very talented Disasterpiece, and you have one of the best indie horror films to come out for some time.</p>

  <h2>Killer Klowns From Outer Space</h2>

  <p>If you couldn't tell yet, I LOVE horror movies. It's hard to pick just 3, but this is definitely one of my favorites. One of my favorite childhood memories was renting this film from the video store. What do you get when you have Killer Klowns that land in a small town and turn people into cotton candy? You have a 90 minute cheesy, hilarious horror movie! The movie doesn't take itself too serious, but has a great soundtrack including the title theme song by The Dickies. If you haven't seen this film yet, I would highly recommend you check it out when you're looking for a fun, horror film.</p>
