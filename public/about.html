<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Sean Peltier. I'm an avid reader, lover of music, video games and all things horror! But most imporatnly, I'm an aspiring Web Developer. I have been coding on and off for the past 10+ years. My biggest achievement to date is my horror website, which is currently under construction, <em>It's A Horrorble Life<em>.</p> 

<p>Since I've started my coding, alot has happened! I built a vinyl collection that I'm very proud of, own enough horror films that would rival any 90's video store and most imporatnly, I'm engaged to my wonderful fiancee', Cat!</p>

<p>I am now 40 and am more motivated than I've ever been. I know the many obstacles that are ahead of me by really diving into the web developer path at this age, but I'm excited about the challenged and the journey!</p>

<p>I hope that you will follow me on my journey on <a href="https://twitter.com/_SeanPeltier" alt="Sean Peltier's Twitter">Twitter</a>.Thanks for taking the time to get to know me. Please feel free to reach out as I'm always happy to get to know new people and learn from your experiences!</p>
